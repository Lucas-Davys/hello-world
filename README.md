Hi, folks!
I'm here to start a journey. A journey to reach the freedom. I wanna to become a programmer, make sites, apps, softwares, anyway, help people with creative solutions to make everyday tasks easier. I believe that this can be an excellent way to improve my earnings and someday I will be able to use this job as my source of income and not depend of anyone.
